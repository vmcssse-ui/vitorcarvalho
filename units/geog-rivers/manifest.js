//   numeric items carry `check` (a Python arithmetic expression) and are recomputed; every misconception carries its own `check`.
//   every mcq / gap answer is compared with the independent answer key held in verify.py, written from the deck.
//   every "order" task is compared with the canonical sequences held in verify.py; every "match" task with its canonical pairs.
//   every case-study number (river lengths, Bangladesh 1998, Thames Barrier) is compared with the FACTS table held in verify.py,

            "High in the sky the air is much colder. The water vapour cools and turns back into tiny droplets of liquid water. This is condensation, and billions of these droplets together make a cloud. Inside the cloud the droplets bump into each other and join up. When they are too heavy to float, they fall.",

That is exactly why floods cause so much damage: the land that floods is the land people most want to use. To reduce the damage, geographers first need to understand the chain of events that turns rain into a flood.",
            "Most river floods follow the same six steps. First, it rains heavily for a long time. Second, the soil soaks up water until it is saturated: it cannot hold any more. Third, infiltration slows down, because water can no longer soak into ground that is already full. Fourth, more and more water flows over the top of the ground as surface run-off, straight into streams and rivers. Fifth, the river level rises quickly. Sixth, the water overflows the banks onto the floodplain. That is the flood."

            "There are two kinds of flood protection. Short-term methods are used just before or during a flood to cope with it. Flood warnings tell people a flood is coming. Sandbags across doorways keep water out of homes. People move valuables upstairs and, if needed, leave their homes for a safe place. Emergency services rescue people and bring food and clean water.",
            "Long-term methods take years to plan and build, but protect people for a long time. Embankments and flood walls raise the sides of the channel so it can hold more water. Dams hold water back upstream and let it out slowly. Barriers like the Thames Barrier close against high water. Dredging deepens the channel. Planting trees in the drainage basin increases infiltration and slows run-off. Planning rules can stop new homes being built on the floodplain.",
            "Notice the difference between reducing the risk of a flood happening (trees, dams, dredging) and reducing the damage when it does (warnings, sandbags, walls around homes). The best plans do both."

            "London lies on the River Thames close to the sea, so a very high tide pushed up the river by a storm could flood the city. The Thames Barrier was built to stop this. It was first used in 1983 and stands about 15 km downstream of the Houses of Parliament, at a spot chosen because the river banks are straight and the river bed is firm enough to build on.",
            "The barrier has ten gates made of steel, stretching about 500 m across the river. Normally the gates lie flat on the river bed so ships can pass. When a dangerous tide is forecast, they are rotated up to form a wall across the river. Closing can take between 15 and 90 minutes. The gates are hollow, and in an underspill position they can let a little water through, so that water does not pour over the top.",
            "Engineers have thought about what could go wrong. If the computer that drives the barrier fails, the gates can be raised by hand with cranks. An extra piston can lift each gate right out of the water so it can be checked for rust and damage. The barrier is a long-term defence: expensive to build, but protecting millions of people for decades."
