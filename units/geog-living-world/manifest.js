//
// MACHINE CHECKS (run `python3 verify.py` in this folder):
//   numeric items carry `check` (a Python arithmetic expression; the FACTS names held in verify.py are allowed) and are recomputed.
//   worked examples / support examples with a calculation carry `checks:[{expr, value, tol}]`.
//   every "order" task is compared with the canonical sequences held in verify.py (the department deck's own sequences).
//   every mcq / gap / match answer is compared with the independent answer key held in verify.py.
//   every case-study number (Epping Forest species counts, the 1976–77 drought and the 15 million trees of 1987, the biome
//   table, the rainforest climate table and its 2360 mm total, Malaysia's 99 % → 60 %, the football-pitch arithmetic, the
//   Sahara's 9 million km², the 250 mm desert threshold, the wild dog count) is checked against the independent FACTS table.
//   passage sentences are counted (≤ 20 words) and all pupil-facing prose (not the arithmetic in `check`) is linted for
//   known misconceptions, the decks' own errors and misspellings (Imozan, Dam gazelle, 3500 square miles, the 13.1 °C
//   winter mean, the 55 % plant-species card), deck model-answer fingerprints, the 29 pupil names on the debate-groups
//   slide, classroom furniture, facts that are not in these decks, and the three other units mixed into the same dump.
//   Pupil-facing text says "your lessons", never "the deck". Corrections to the decks are listed in NOTES.md section 4.
//   astra/2: every mcq/gap carries per-wrong-option `feedback`; every numeric carries `misconceptions`; every module carries
//   `explain`; ≥ 1 module per chapter carries `contexts` that never redefine the answer; `connections` ⊂ glossary;
//   meta.constellation is omitted (the engine lays the stars out); no pretext.l1 (translation is a separate pass).
//   verify.py also runs a mutation self-test: it tampers with a copy of this manifest in eight ways and must catch every one.
// Diagrams (food webs, biome maps, climate graphs, soil profiles, rainforest layers) are described in words; no widget exists for them.

Your lessons split it into three components: plants, animals and the environment they live in. Geographers also sort the parts into biotic (living: plants, animals, fungi) and abiotic (non-living: soil, water, air, sunlight, temperature). None of these parts works alone. Plants need water, light and nutrients from the soil; animals need plants, or other animals, for food; dead plants and animals feed the fungi and worms that return nutrients to the soil. Depending on each other like this is called interdependence. Your lesson gave a simple example: we depend on plants for oxygen and food, and plants depend on us for the carbon dioxide we breathe out.",

A global, large-scale ecosystem is called a biome: a tropical rainforest, a deciduous woodland or a hot desert stretching across whole regions of the Earth. The same ideas (components, interdependence, food chains) work at both scales, which is why the unit starts small, in a forest on the edge of London, before going global.",

Below it is a shrub layer of holly and hazel at about 5 m, and under that a field layer of grasses, brambles, bracken, ferns and flowering plants. The shrub layer is where you might find 20 species of dragonfly. The forest is also home to 177 species of moss and lichen.",

It always starts with a producer: a plant, such as an oak tree or grass, that converts energy from the sun into sugars by photosynthesis. Everything else is a consumer, a living thing that gets its energy by eating plants or other animals. A herbivore eats plants; a carnivore eats other animals. Decomposers, such as fungi, earthworms and woodlice, break down dead plant and animal material and return the nutrients to the soil, where producers can use them again.",

The arrows in a food chain point from the thing being eaten to the thing that eats it, because they show the direction the energy flows. Energy goes from the oak leaves into the caterpillar, from the caterpillar into the sparrow, and from the sparrow into the fox. Nothing in the forest eats the fox or the deer; your fact files note that they are killed only by humans.",

            "The UK's natural biome is deciduous forest, which is why your unit studied a woodland. A healthy woodland is in balance: the numbers of trees, insects, birds and mammals stay roughly steady from year to year. Periods of extreme weather, and climate change, can disturb that balance. In 1976 to 1977 England experienced a drought that killed many trees. Then, in 1987, a great storm felled a further 15 million trees.",
            "Losing so many trees changed the species mix of the ecosystem, and population numbers declined for many of the food species in the food chain: fewer leaves and acorns meant fewer caterpillars and squirrels, and so on up the web. But woodlands can recover. Secondary forest growth took place as new trees grew up in the gaps, and the consumer species migrated back. Your lesson calls the recovery of the English woodlands an example of ecosystem resilience: the ability of an ecosystem to bounce back after a shock.",
            "Resilience has limits. An ecosystem recovers from a one-off storm because the soil, the seeds and the neighbouring habitats are still there. Take those away and recovery may be impossible, which is where human change comes in."

            "Ecosystems are sometimes damaged in permanent ways, especially when human forces such as deforestation are involved. Removing the forest leaves the soil bare under the rain, and once that soil has washed off the slope the ecosystem has nothing left to rebuild itself from. Climate change works more slowly but pushes the same way: if southern England grows warmer and its rainfall less dependable, a woodland such as Epping Forest may not be able to hold the mixture of species it holds today.",
            "Because everything in a food web is linked, a change to one species has knock-on effects on others. Your lesson used an oak woodland web in which beetles are eaten by woodpeckers, and woodpeckers by owls and hawks. Suppose disease reduces the beetle population. The direct effect: woodpeckers have fewer meals, so their numbers may decline, while the oak trees may grow better because fewer beetles are feeding on them. The indirect effects: owl and hawk numbers may fall because they feed on woodpeckers; or the woodpeckers, which have several food sources, may simply eat more caterpillars, which would then cause problems for the blue tits that also depend on caterpillars.",
            "Ecosystems can also be restored deliberately. In Epping Forest, cattle grazing has been reintroduced to encourage the growth of vegetation, including veteran trees such as oak, whose numbers fell between 1976 and 1988 because of drought and storm damage. Grazing animals keep the grass short and their hooves open up bare ground, which lets low-growing flowers such as bird's-foot trefoil thrive in a way that mowing would not. More oak means more food for the animals that depend on it, so the number of species is kept up or increased."

            "Global ecosystems, or biomes, are defined by their dominant vegetation: forest, grassland, scrub, desert or tundra. Each has its own climate. Your class built a table of them in your lessons. Tropical rainforest lies close to the equator and is hot (25 to 30°C) and wet (around 2000 to 3000 mm a year) all year round. Deserts lie at roughly 30° north and south of the equator, very hot throughout the year (over 30°C) with very little rain (less than about 300 mm). Mediterranean woodland and scrub lies at about 40 to 45° north and south, with hot summers (20 to 25°C), mild winters (10 to 15°C), dry summers and wet winters (about 800 mm).",
            "Further north, at roughly 50 to 60°, come the temperate forests. Deciduous woodland, the UK's biome, has warm summers (15 to 20°C), reasonably cold winters (3 to 7°C) and precipitation throughout the year (about 1000 mm). Coniferous woodland has warm summers (12 to 18°C), very cold winters (below 0°C for up to half the year), low rainfall (about 500 mm, mainly in summer) and winter snow. Tundra stretches from the Arctic Circle to about 60 to 70° north, for example in Canada: Arctic winters, warmest months of only 0 to 10°C, and yearly precipitation, including melting snow, of just 15 to 25 cm.",
            "Why do biomes form broad belts across the world? Because climate is controlled above all by latitude. The sun's energy is strongest at the equator and weakest at the poles, and the way air circulates around the globe (rising at the equator, sinking at about 30°, rising again further north) decides where it rains and where it does not. Match the climate belts to the vegetation belts and you have the map of the world's biomes. Mountains, ocean currents and distance from the sea tweak the pattern, which is why the belts are not perfectly straight."

The largest rainforests are in South America (for example Brazil, which has the biggest area of all), Africa (the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and South East Asia (Indonesia, and the case-study country Malaysia). Many areas of the world's rainforests are being cut down: that is deforestation, the subject of chapter 4.",

Below them the crowns of most trees join to form the canopy, the densest layer, which blocks out the sunlight to the layers beneath and is home to eagles, butterflies and bats. Your lessons give a striking figure for the canopy: it is often said to hold about half of all the species on Earth. The understorey (also called the undercanopy) lies between the canopy and the ground; birds, insects and snakes are found there in abundance, and lianas climb up the trunks of larger trees to reach the light.",

Fungi feed on the decaying leaves and branches that rain down from above, and larger animals such as deer move about on the floor. Each layer has its own light, moisture and food, and so its own community."

The heavy rain leaches (washes) the nutrients down and out of the soil, so below the surface there is little for roots to feed on.",
            "The most fertile part of the soil is right at the surface. There is a constant supply of dead leaves falling from the canopy, and in the heat and damp the decomposers break them down quickly into a thick layer of humus. Nutrients are released, taken up by roots and used by the trees before the rain can wash them away. That is the answer to your stretch question: the latosol is infertile, yet it grows an abundance of plants, because the nutrients are recycled so fast at the surface that the trees never need to rely on the poor soil beneath.",
            "It also explains a plant adaptation. Because the nutrients are at the surface, trees have shallow roots to absorb them. Shallow roots cannot anchor a 50 m tree on their own, so the tree grows buttress roots as well."

            "Plants have adapted to heat, heavy rain and fierce competition for light. Buttress roots are massive ridges at the base of the trunk that support tall trees and stop them toppling, and increase the surface area through which the tree exchanges gases. Drip tip leaves let the heavy rain run off so the leaves do not snap. Lianas are woody creepers that root in the ground but climb other trees to be carried up to the canopy where there is more sunlight. Epiphytes live on branches; they do not root in the ground but take their nutrients from the air and rain. Fast-growing trees race upwards to compete for light, since so little reaches the floor; the winners become emergents. Thin, smooth bark lets water flow down the trunk easily, and many flexible leaves can turn to face the sun to maximise photosynthesis.",
            "Animals are adapted too. The toucan nests in tree holes to hide from predators; its large, colourful bill helps to deter predators and its bright colours attract a mate, and strong claws grip the branches. The anteater has a long, sticky tongue to pull ants and termites out of their nests, huge clawed paws to break the nests open, and a long tail for climbing and balance. The red-eyed tree frog has suction cups on its toes so it can climb trees and cling to leaves; it feeds on smaller frogs, insects and crickets, and when it sleeps it hides its bright red eyes and blue and orange markings so it is harder to spot.",

          paragraphs: [
            "Deforestation is the action or process of clearing forests. Your keyword list gives the main causes in Malaysia. Commercial logging removes valuable hardwood timber for export; enormous quantities of tropical hardwood are shipped from South East Asia to industrial countries such as Japan. Palm oil plantations replace forest with a single crop whose oil goes into food, soap and fuel. Mineral extraction (mining) clears forest and digs it up. Subsistence farming by poor families clears small plots, often by slash and burn: cutting the trees and burning them to release nutrients into the soil for a few years of crops. Transmigration is a government moving people from crowded areas into forest areas to farm. Roads, settlements and hydroelectric power (HEP) dams clear or flood more.",
            "Your card sort added the wider reasons behind the clearing, using examples from South America as well as Asia. Cattle ranchers growing meat for home markets and for export (the beef burger market of North America) have cleared huge areas. Poor families, for example from the dry north east of Brazil, face a choice between moving to overcrowded cities, clearing forest for farmland, or going hungry. In 27 tropical countries, a quarter of all export earnings goes to repay debt to banks and governments in rich countries, so the forest is sold to pay the bills. Mineral wealth draws in more than 200 000 gold miners in the Brazilian Amazon, and the Carajas iron ore project, part-funded by the World Bank, threatens 16 % of the Amazonian rainforest. Huge HEP projects, funded from rich countries, have flooded large areas, drowning forest and poisoning rivers.",
            "Notice that almost every cause is economic. Timber, oil palm, minerals, beef and electricity all earn money, and a country repaying debt needs money fast. That is why stopping deforestation is so hard, and why chapter 4 ends with ways of earning from the forest without destroying it."

          paragraphs: [
            "Your lesson set four objectives on the impacts of deforestation in Malaysia, and the first is soil erosion. Tree roots hold the soil together and the canopy breaks the force of the rain. Remove them and the heavy tropical rain hits bare ground, washes the soil into rivers and leaches out what nutrients remain. The land quickly becomes useless for farming, so farmers clear more forest, and the silt chokes the rivers. The second impact is on biodiversity. Clearing destroys habitats; species that live only in that forest have nowhere else to go, and plants that might have given us medicines are lost.",
            "The third impact is global: climate change. Trees take in carbon dioxide as they grow and store the carbon in their wood. When forest is burned, that carbon goes straight back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, adding to global warming, and the lost trees can no longer absorb carbon in future. Forests also return moisture to the air, so large-scale clearing can make the regional climate drier.",
            "The fourth objective is economic, and it has two sides. Deforestation brings gains: jobs in logging, mining and plantations, export income from timber and palm oil, electricity from HEP dams, and tax for an NEE that needs to develop. It also brings losses: soil that can no longer be farmed, flooding and silted rivers that cost money to repair, and the loss of future income from tourism and medicines. Your lesson asked you to sort impacts into social, environmental, economic and political, and into positive and negative. A top answer does both."

          paragraphs: [
            "Sustainable development means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future. For a rainforest it means using its resources in a way that keeps the forest for the future, while still allowing economic development and protecting the health of the people who live there. Your Amazon lesson looked at five strategies. Selective logging cuts trees only when they reach a particular height, so younger trees are left with a guaranteed life span and the forest regains full maturity after around 30 to 50 years; the canopy is protected, parent trees drop seeds and the roots keep the topsoil healthy, yet money is still made from timber. Its weakness: illegal loggers do not follow the rules. Agroforestry grows valuable crops such as coffee and cacao under the canopy; nothing is cleared, leaf litter keeps the soil fertile so less fertiliser is needed, and fruit trees such as avocado and guava go on producing year after year. The main drawback is the risk from introduced non-native species.",
            "Forest reserves, also called national parks, are large protected areas where no logging is allowed, preserving untouched forest for the future. In 2002 Brazil created the biggest one anywhere: Tumucumaque, in the northern state of Amapa, which protects nearly 4 million hectares and shelters jaguars, sloths and freshwater turtles. Critics worry that corruption and a lack of funding mean poaching and illegal logging continue; park staff on very low wages may be open to bribery, so the park seeks money from the World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank. Afforestation is the opposite of deforestation: replanting trees to restore the canopy. The Brazilian state of Para set a goal of replanting 1 billion trees to replace those lost to logging, funded by government and private companies, aiming to cut greenhouse gases by 5 %. But a tropical tree takes around 30 years to mature, so a rainforest ecosystem is slow to re-establish. Satellite monitoring uses satellite images, aerial photography and GIS to track changes in the forest, spot where deforestation is speeding up and send teams to challenge illegal logging. A non-profit organisation (Imazon) working with the Brazilian government used real-time images and a system of sanctions and rewards, and in 2013 the deforestation rate fell by 70 % compared with the previous year.",
            "Why is sustainable management so hard in the Amazon? Your class listed the barriers: it covers nine South American countries, which must co-operate; poverty means the need to develop outweighs protection; illegal logging is hard to stop; people need education; patrolling a vast area costs money; and the growing demand for food, farmland and palm oil is difficult to resist. Your stakeholder debate (government, indigenous people, a meat company, an environmental campaigner) showed that each group values the forest differently, and that is why a conclusion must weigh the sides rather than pick one."

The forest has been cleared for hardwood timber exported to countries such as Japan, for palm oil plantations, for mining and for HEP dams, and these bring jobs, export income and tax to a developing country, so the forest clearly has value when cut. However, the costs are large and lasting. Without roots and canopy the heavy rain erodes the soil and silts the rivers, so the land soon becomes useless; Peninsular Malaysia's 600 or so bird species and over 25 % of the country's plants, including 850 orchid species, lose their habitat, and undiscovered medicines are lost with them; and burning the forest releases stored carbon, adding to global climate change. The standing forest also earns money through tourism and could be used sustainably: selective logging still produces timber while the forest recovers in 30 to 50 years, and agroforestry grows coffee and cacao under the canopy. Overall I agree to a large extent: cutting the forest brings quick income, but a standing, sustainably managed forest keeps its soil, wildlife, climate role and future income, which is worth more in the long run."

            "Hot deserts are arid areas of land with poor, sandy soil, typically receiving less than 25 cm (250 mm) of precipitation a year. Summer daytime temperatures can reach or exceed 50°C, yet nights can be very cold. Most lie in two belts, roughly 30° north and 30° south of the equator, usually in dry continental interiors. Your lessons name the Sahara (North Africa), the Colorado Desert and the Great Basin Desert in the USA (an unusual one, because most of its precipitation falls as snow), the Mojave, the Thar Desert in India and Pakistan, and the Gobi in Asia.",
            "Why 30°? Air that was heated at the equator rises, cools and spreads out towards the poles high in the atmosphere. At around 30° it sinks back towards the ground. Sinking air forms a persistent belt of high pressure, and sinking air does not make cloud or rain, so the skies stay clear and the ground bakes. The same lack of cloud lets the heat escape at night, which is why desert nights are so cold. Two other factors help to form deserts: mountain ranges create rain shadows, so only very dry air moves beyond them, and cold ocean currents offshore chill the air so that it carries little moisture inland.",
            "The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world. It blankets much of the northern third of Africa, about 9 million square kilometres, stretching some 3000 miles from the Atlantic Ocean to the Nile and the Red Sea and more than 1000 miles south from the Atlas Mountains to the Sahel. It is more than 16 times the size of France and covers all or part of countries including Mauritania, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Niger, Tunisia, Mali, Chad and Sudan."

            "Desert climates swing further between day and night than any other climate you study. By mid-afternoon the air may be up at 50°C; by dawn it can have dropped below 0°C, because there is no cloud to keep the day's heat in. There is very little rainfall, less than 250 mm a year, and it is unreliable: months of arid conditions are broken by sudden stormy downpours. Winters are mild and summers very hot. Your Sahara climate graph showed a peak temperature of 35°C in July and August, a winter average of about 13°C from December to February, just 2 mm of rain in December, and no rain at all in June, July and September. The conclusion your class wrote: the lower the rainfall, the higher the temperature, and the higher the rainfall, the lower the temperature.",
            "Desert soils are sandy or stony, with little organic matter because there is so little vegetation to rot into them. They are dry, but can soak up water rapidly after rain. As water evaporates it pulls dissolved salts up with it, and a pale crust is often left behind where it has gone. Put together, this means desert soils are not particularly fertile, and strong winds blow away layers of topsoil, leaving them thin.",
            "The components of a desert ecosystem are tightly interdependent. The climate (abiotic) is dry, dries out the soil and decides which plants and animals can survive the heat. The soil (abiotic) is dry and thin because of the heat and wind. The vegetation (biotic) is sparse and low-growing because of the lack of rain and the infertile soil. The animals (biotic) have adapted to the harsh climate by storing water, and because the vegetation is so sparse they must roam large areas to find enough to eat."

What they all need is water, so they gather into small pockets around oases and around the seasonal rivers and lakes that fill and dry again. Biodiversity, the range of plant and animal life in a place, is therefore low across the desert as a whole but concentrated where there is water.",
            "That makes it fragile. Human activities such as farming, irrigation and pumping out groundwater threaten those water sources. Climate change is reducing the snowpack and melting the glaciers that feed water to desert communities and wildlife, and longer droughts dry up supplies faster still. The result is habitat loss, and deserts are losing their biodiversity. In the Sahara, animals such as the addax, the cheetah and the dama gazelle are at risk of extinction. The African wild dog is one of the most endangered mammals in the world, with only about 6600 left, most of them in southern Africa and the southern Sahara in Niger; its threats are habitat loss and being killed to protect farm livestock, because when its prey disappears it turns to goats and sheep.",

Cacti such as the saguaro have large stems that store water, collected by their roots, for the long summer drought; the stem swells after rain. They have spines instead of leaves, which lose far less water and protect the plant from herbivores, and a waxy coating on the stem; their pores close in the heat of the day and open at night. Many desert plants, like the desert holly, have small waxy leaves or needles, and some shrubs simply drop their leaves and go dormant in summer. Flowering plants bloom and set seed quickly after any rain. A succulent is any plant that stores water in thick, fleshy leaves or stems.",

The camel has thick fur on top of its body for shade and thin fur elsewhere to lose heat; large, flat feet that spread its weight on sand; a fatty hump that provides energy when food is short; slit-like nostrils and two rows of eyelashes to keep out wind-blown sand; and it loses very little water through urine or sweat, so it can go a long time without drinking. The fennec fox has large ears that give off heat. The cottontail rabbit avoids the heat by being nocturnal, active only at night.

            "Your Sahara case study asked what the desert offers for development. The keyword list points to its natural resources: water, minerals and fossil fuels. Beneath the Sahara lie huge underground reserves of water in aquifers, which your class mapped using a GIS website. The rocks hold minerals, and North Africa has large deposits of oil and gas that earn export income for the countries that own them. Desert agriculture farms crops well suited to arid conditions, such as sorghum. Agroforestry grows crops with the support of trees, which provide shade and keep the soil stable. The mark scheme also credits recreation and tourism, and the economic benefits that follow: jobs, spending in the local economy and improved infrastructure.",
            "Each opportunity can solve a challenge, which is how your worksheet asked you to match them. Groundwater from aquifers answers the arid climate; agroforestry answers thin soils and wind erosion; income from fossil fuels pays for the roads and pipelines the desert lacks. The pattern is the same as in the rainforest: the resources are real, but using them costs money and risks damage.",

Your recall list of physical challenges ran: an arid climate, extreme heat, floods (sudden downpours on hard, bare ground), a hostile ecosystem, salty soils, thin soils, shifting sands, wind erosion and dust storms, and thin vegetation. These are problems the desert itself sets.",
            "The human challenges were the cards in your diamond nine: remoteness and a lack of roads, the high cost of providing water, salinisation, desertification, population growth, pollution threats, the existing nomadic populations and the need for conservation. The desert is inaccessible, so infrastructure (roads, pipes, power lines) must be built from scratch at great cost. Supplying water means pumping it from deep aquifers or piping it long distances, and irrigating with it brings its own problem: in the heat the water evaporates and leaves its salts behind, so the soil becomes saline and infertile. People already live there: nomadic herders move their camels and goats to find grazing in a land where plants are sparse, and development can take away their land and water.",
            "Your six-mark model on how the desert climate affects people made three developed points: heat and dryness mean sparse vegetation, so herders must keep moving; long summer droughts mean people must store food and water for months; and sandy, infertile soil plus dust storms that flatten fields make crop farming hard and keep farmers poor. Each point goes from climate to plants or soil to people, which is what the examiner means by developed."

It happens in the arid zones bordering the deserts, places with an average annual rainfall of about 100 to 300 mm, such as the Sahel on the southern edge of the Sahara. The land does not become sand dunes overnight; it loses its plants and its topsoil until it can no longer grow crops or feed animals.",
            "Your card sort separated causes, effects and solutions. The causes are partly natural and partly human. Rainfall at the desert edge is unreliable, and climate change is making droughts longer. Population growth puts more pressure on the land. Overgrazing, feeding too many livestock for too long on the land so that it cannot recover its vegetation, strips the ground bare. Over-cultivation, growing crops so intensively that the soil is exhausted, leaves it barren. Trees are cut for fuelwood, so there are no roots to hold the soil. Together these leave the soil exposed to sun, wind and the occasional downpour.",
            "The effects follow. Soil erosion removes topsoil faster than it can be replaced, by wind and by water. Salinisation, a build-up of salt on the surface where irrigation water evaporates, makes the remaining soil infertile. Crops fail, animals die, and people face hunger and poverty; many leave the land and migrate to towns. Your lesson asked you to sort causes and effects into social, economic and environmental (SEE) and to rank them: which should be tackled first?"

For the desert edge, sustainable solutions tend to be small, cheap and local. Appropriate technology is technology suited to the needs, skills, knowledge and wealth of local people and their environment: things a village can build and mend itself. Contour traps are embankments built along the contours of slopes to stop soil being washed down during heavy rainfall; they hold the soil and the water where crops can use them. In the Thar Desert your lessons name johads, small man-made water stores, and tobas, natural depressions that fill with rain and provide drinking water.",
            "Other solutions attack the causes directly: planting trees to shelter fields and hold the soil, managing the number of animals so grazing land can recover, and resting fields so they are not over-cultivated. Adaptation means adjusting to natural events such as climate change to reduce the damage, limit the impacts and cope with the consequences, rather than hoping the rains return.",

            model: "The Sahara covers about 9 million km² of the northern third of Africa, at roughly 30° north of the equator. It offers real opportunities. Vast aquifers beneath the sand could supply water for farming; the rocks hold minerals, and oil and gas earn large export incomes for countries such as Algeria and Libya; desert agriculture can grow drought-resistant crops such as sorghum, and agroforestry uses trees to shade crops and hold the soil. However, the challenges are severe. Physically, temperatures reach 50°C by day and fall below freezing at night, rainfall is under 250 mm a year and unreliable, soils are thin, sandy and salty, and shifting sands and dust storms bury fields and roads. Human challenges add to this: the desert is remote and inaccessible, so roads, pipelines and power lines must be built at great cost; pumping water from deep aquifers is expensive, and irrigating with it causes salinisation that ruins the soil; nomadic herders already depend on the land and water; and desertification is spreading along the edges. Many opportunities therefore create their own challenges. Overall, I agree only to a small extent: the Sahara offers valuable resources, but the cost, heat, dryness and inaccessibility mean that development is possible only in a few places and with heavy investment."
